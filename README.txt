Rubiks Cube Solver:

Description: This program solves a rubiks cube using the beginner method
algorithms. The "virtual" rubiks cube is represented using a 3x3 multidimensional
array. 

How To Use: Download all files into a folder and run: "javac Rubix.java"
in a terminal to compile (navigate to file first). To run, use: "java Rubix"
after compiling. Input your rubiks cube into the class "Cube" in cube.java 
and re-compile to solve your unique cube. Make sure front is green, right
is red, left is orange, back is blue, top is white, and bottom is yellow. 

Motivation: This program was developed to 1) improve my skills in java, and 2)
to see if I could do it. I knew how to solve a rubiks cube in real life, and 
I was curious to see if I could translate that to code.
